Keywords
========

*alias* - aliases a method name, consider alias\_method instead...

*and* version of *&&* with lower precedence

*BEGIN* a code block that is to be run unconditionally at the start (out of
sequence with the restof the code - BEGIN {}

*begin* starts a begin block, commonly seen in exception handling

*break* comes out of a block, unconditionally passing control to the next line.
Anything after the break call is returned as the value of the broken block

*case* opens a switch statement, takes an argument and then compares the
argument to conditions within the statement unde the keyword *when*

*class* opens a class definition block, see module below

*def* opens a method definition block, takes an argument for the method's name

*defined?* takes an expression as an argument and ftells you whether it works
in your current environment.

*do* starts a block, can use { instead

*else* default action if conditions of *if* statement aren't met

*elsif* adds an additional if clause to an if statement

*END* opens a code balck that will always run at the program's conclusion

*end* ends a block of code, lots of them - do, def, class, if.

*ensure* part of exception handling, ensures that the code in the clause runs

*false* boolean false value

*for* start of a for loop statement, i.e. for e in 1..10 do etc. #each is
preferable

*in* see above

*module* opens a module definition block. Takes an argument for the module name
-- must be a constant. And yes it has its own scope.

*next* jumps an iterator to the next iteration, skipping the rest of the block.
Can even take an an argument which will be returned as the value for the current
iteration. How cool is that.

*nil* nothing, nada. One of two Ruby falsies, the only instance of NilClass,
the value of all uninitialized values.

*not* negation, and consider using !=

*or* is or, lower precedence than the more popular ||

*redo* unconditional re-execution of a code block

*rescue*  the exception handling clause, usually in the begin block, can take
the specific error type to handle as an argument

*retry* inside the rescue block, sends you back to the beginning of the block
(begin), to, wel, to try again!

*return* comes out of the block executing, after *ensure* executes, returning
control to the method calling. Takes an argument which will then be the returnedvalue of the method.

*self* the identity of the self in Ruby is fluid, but refers usually to the
object the method is occurring in, or the class/module being defined. It is the default receiver of all messages that don't have an explicit receiver (for instance 'puts')

*super*, executed in a method, searches up the hierarchy of the object in
question (the method lookup path) for the next method with the same name as the
one being executed, and then runs it. If executed with no arguments it uses the
arguments from method currently executing, otherwise you can add your own
arguments of just put () for none.

*then* - syntactic sugar for an if statement, making it look good on one line
-- which it does.

*true* not false. Everything in Ruby is true, apart from nil and false

*undef* OK, this is just freaky. Undef undefines a given method in the
class/module it's called in. Ancestral spirits (and classes and methods) are
unaffected. Why would anyone want to do that?

*unless* a neater way of saying if (not x) then y, by saying y unless x

*until* opens a loop block that runs until a given condition is true - inverse
of while

*when* - the clause of a case switch. (Not the claws of Axos)

*while* the opposite of until.

Data Types
==========

*true* - the result of a true logical statement i.e. 2 > 1. Or just "bob".
Everything is true other than...

*false* - the output of a false logical statement, i.e. 2 < 1. The only other
falsie is...

*nil* - nothing, nada. The result of an uninitialized element in an array or
hash. `Array.new(3)` will give you a three element array, all with nil values.

*constants* constant variables. Start with a capital letter, and goes on from
there in the same fashion, splitting words up with underscores. The only real
distinction is that Ruby throws a hissy fit when you change a constant. Well,
a constant warning anyway.

*strings* are a data type which take alphanumeric characters and some other
formatting codes like \n for newlines. Placed in double quotes (where escape
characters will work), single quotes (where they won't), or an exciting variety
of % methods, my favourite of which is %{}.

*numbers* are just numbers, initialized by assigning a raw number to a variable
x = 1 style. Of course, it's never that easy and the Numeric class encompasses
Integers, Foats, Bignums and Fixnums to name just a few. But Ruby will just
handle them all. And by handle I mean coerce the type. Clever Ruby.

*ranges* in Ruby are wonderfully simple, taking two inputs and defining the
range between them as inclusive (..) or exclulsive (...). For instance `1..10`
is one to ten inclusive. Can even take characters - i.e. `a..z`.

*arrays* are a data structure of elements, in an order. Most easily initialized
with an assignment of x = [1,2,3]. The elements may be accessed by giving their
index (starting at 0) in the square brackets - x[0] is 1. May be made
multidimensional by nesting the arrays within each other (as the element of an
array can be anything). Other languages like to know how big your array is
going to be when you start - Ruby just stretches and shrinks it as you need.
Clever Ruby!

*hashes* are another data structure, made of key-value pairs (think JSON), of
varying length. A Hash is initialized with either Hash.new, or x = {}

Escape Sequences
================

*\\* It's \
*\'* It's '
*\"* "
*\a* alert a bell
*\b* backspace
*\f* formfeed (aka page break)
*\n* newline
*\r* carriage return
*\t* tab
*\v* vertical tab(!)

Operators
=========

*::* is, as I recall, a way of accessing modules/classes/methods inside classes
and modules. Useful for namespacing. For instance `Violin::String` is not the
same as an `Object::String`

*[]* an operator that does a few things. The argument goes within the brackets
and can take regexs, string matches, a start and end value, a range... and
that's just for strings. It is mostly found to get the element from an array at
a specific index, or the value from a hash with a specific key. As *[]=* it can
be used for assignment.

*-(unary)* and by unary we mean only one argument. It sets an number to be
a negative number.

*+(unary)* world's most pointless operator. Returns the receiver's value. Or,
in layman's terms, +1 is the same as 1.

*!* negation, Boolean negate. This comes all the way from `BasicObject` so it
must be important...

*~* eeee... now this is more exciting. Unary operator, returns the one's
complement of the receiver. Appears in FixNum. Basically what we have here is
bit flipping, flipping the bit that handles the postive/negative sign of the
integer in question. Doesn't work for floats. `~2 => -3`

\*\*\* is the multiplication operator. Takes an argument of a number, returns
the product of the receiver and the argument.

*/* as above but for division

*%* as above, but returns the modulo (the remainder after division)

*+* as above, addition

*-* as above, subtraction

*<<* the shovel, used for a number of things, but adds things to the end of
a string, array `[1,2] << 3 +=> [1,2,3]` More excitingly on Fixnums it works as
a bit shift operator, shifting the bits of the receiver value (as a decimal) the
number of the argument to the left. i.e. if the number is 3, the binary is 0011
bitshift 2 gives 1100, or 12 More excitingly on Fixnums it works as a bit
shiftoperator, shifting the bits of the receiver value (as a decimal) the number
of the argument to the left. i.e. if the number is 3, the binary is 0011,
bitshift 2 gives 1100, or 12.  *>>* is the right bit shift operator, so if we
take the 12 1100 and shift 1, we
get 0110, or 6.

*&* is another bitwise operator, which returns the bits that are present in both
the integers. So... if we go with `12 & 6`, the only bits present in both `1100`
and `0110` is the third one (counting from the right), so we get `0100` or `6`.

*|* the bitwise or. For 12 and 6 above we would get 14.

*^* we're doing out of order, but in the rigth place. This is the bitwise XOR,
only if the bit is in either, but not in both, does it get returned. For 12
and 6 we would get 10.

*>* it's greater than

*>=* or equal to

*<* less than

*<=* or equal to

*<=>* The saucer of DOOM! No, it's the combined comparison operator, which
returns 1 if the argument is larger than the receiver, -1 for larger receivers,
and 0 when equal. Used rarely, but it's always awesome when it comes up. Great
for custom `#sort`s

*==* tests for equality (and will do a bit of type coercion so that `1.0 == 1 =>true`

*===* is pretty much the same for your average everyday `Object`, but gets used
for other fun stuff further down the hierarchy in `case` statements - it's what
makes them work for more than just out and out equality (they'll take ranges,
regexes, procs, lambdas... good times.)

*!=* tests for inquality in a similar way to *==*

*=~* a search operator, with varying implementations given the receiver. For
instance with a String it'll return the zero-based location of the regex
argument.
