The Ruby Class Adventure Game
=============================

Plan
----

Write a trip around the map of the Ruby inheritance/class system... from the
inside.

Room one - you're a dog called Fido, and you're in a room called 'Dog'. Exits
include one door marked 'super' and one door marked 'class'.

And you're on a quest to become a number.

And so on from there...
